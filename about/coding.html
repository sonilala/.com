I've been using Arch Linux to do my Year 13 Computing coursework, having had to install pretty much all of the operating system through Bash commands; which is pretty hard if you haven't tried it. I making constant use of the terminal emulator for things such as sudo commands (the pacman package manager's command is my favourite) and pushing commits to GitHub. </p>

That's a lot to talk about in one go but those are pretty much all the languages I use to make websites like this one. HTML and CSS being the standard for creating static webpages and designing them which in itself, isn't hard to do. All of the PHP I've learned is procedural since I haven't tackled object oriented programming probably yet. Most of the websites I create use some sort of MySQL database (I use phpMyAdmin to manage those), requiring me to implement a mix between PHP and MySQL to create awesome, random fact generating pages!</p>
