                    <h1>Support Me</h1>
                    <p>Most of the stuff I create, I release for free and we all know that isn't the best way to make money but it's the best way give out my stuff to everyone! You can help fund my projects by supporting me in numerous ways:</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="page-content">
                    <p>It's quite simple really, if you want to suppport me but don't feel like money is an option just using my stuff is extremely helpful! Not only does it show me that you like the things I make, it increases the likelyhood of other people using it. Let's take this example, if you use the todo list app (that me and Sonia are planning to create) often then our page ranks will increase meaning it'll become easier for people to find our product, making it more likely for our user base to grow and with an increased user base the price for ad space on the site will increase too. And all you've done is reminded yourself to buy milk!</p>
                    <p style="padding-bottom:40px;">If you really like my stuff, don't forget to share it. A simple tweet means the world to me!</p>

I plan on using Project Wonderful for the majority of my projects (including this website) in the near future, if you have your own "thing" that you want to get out there but also want to help me then why not advertise on my sites? I'm going to be setting up my Project Wonderful page so there'll be more information soon!</p>
